In this session we will configure required IAM roles and permissions for Systems
Manager OpsCenter, configure basic rules and use these rules to monitor and
report on issues related to Auto Scaling group events.

We will then use Systems Manager Automation to remediate the issue with the Auto
Scaling group configuration.

Setup the basic rules in OpsCenter

![](media/52eb2e5b2f1bd82671e1d462421d0da5.png)

We do not need to create notifications when the alarm is triggered.

Click **Next**

1.  On the **Add description** screen provide a unique alarm name, e.g
    **BelowDesiredCapacity** and click **Next**

2.  On the **Preview and create** screen scroll to the bottom and click **Create
    Alarm**

    We have created a CloudWatch alrm which will be triggered if the number of
    instances in the Auto Scaling group falls below 2

Demonstrate the Creation of OpsItems
------------------------------------

1.  Open the EC2 console

2.  Verify that the Auto Scaling group exists by selecting Auto Scaling Groups
    from the menu on the left

    ![](media/062181c0d1108a14e0f9dca2f6a95e16.png)

    Verify that the **Instance** count and **Desired** count are set to the
    number 2

3.  Select **AMI** menu item under **Images** menu

![](media/87190a05eb2a025fa7c23548bed48c8d.png)

1.  Deregister the custom AMI that we created earlier and which was used to
    create the Auto Scaling group by selecting Actions – Deregister from the
    pull down menu

![](media/29e1bb9bc397135616fb38da83552163.png)

1.  Confirm the operation by clicking Continue on the **Deregister** screen.

2.  Click on the **Instances** menu item under **Instances** menu on the left
    side

3.  Select one of the instances belonging to the Auto Scaling Group, then select
    **Instance State – Terminate** from the **Actions** pull down menu.

![](media/a1c2524b56275d38a9106cdaf5d1f562.png)

1.  On **Terminate Instances** screen confirm termination by clicking **Yes,
    Terminate**

    The instance should enter the **shutting-down** state.

By terminating the instance we brought the total instance count below the
desired instance count of 2 which should trigger the Cloudwatch alarm and auto
scaling event. However, since we deleted the custom AMI, the Auto Scaling should
fail and the failure will be captured by OpsCenter. In the next section we will
examine the OpsItem created by OpsCenter in response to the Auto Scaling
failure.

Explore OpsItems
----------------

1.  Open the **Systems Manager** console from the **Services** menu and select
    OpsCenter

![](media/5ecd6c18a91caa81123a34cda0267dff.png)

1.  In the Summary Screen you should see the EC2 Auto Scaling source with 1
    OpsItem.

    Note: If you don’t see the **EC2 Auto Scaling OpsItem**, wait a few minutes
    and refresh the screen.

2.  Click on 1 next to the EC2 Auto Scaling source

3.  In the **OpsItems** screen you should see the OpsItem ID with **Auto Scaling
    EC2 instance launch failure** title.

4.  Click on the **OpsItem ID** to open the details of the **Auto Scaling EC2
    instance launch failure** OpsItem.

5.  Scroll down to the Operational data section and open the section by clicking
    on the black triangle

    ![](media/4a9a079db342c8c44daaabfcc6888d25.png)

    As you can see OpsItem contains detailed explanation of the event that
    triggered the failure and the reason for the failure.

6.  Scroll up and click on the Resource ARN

    ![](media/d7bb5d778dd731b2b6e78ad6c95ee646.png)

7.  In the Related Resource details screen click on Expand all to display all
    related resources

8.  Examine the following sections of the OpsItem Related resource:

-   Tags

-   Current CloudWatch alarms

-   Details from AWS Config

-   CloudTrail Logs

-   CloudFormation stack resources

Resolve the issue by running SSM Automation Document
----------------------------------------------------

Now we will resolve the issue of not being able to launch the instance from the
deleted AMI by re-creating the AMI and updating the Launch Configuration.

1.  Open the Systems Manager console

2.  Select **Automation** from the menu on the left.

3.  Select **Execute Automation**

4.  In the **Choose document** screen select Owned by me

5.  Select the document that was created by the CloudFormation

6.  Select **Execute Automation**

7.  Leave the **Simple Execution** (default) and provide the Auto Scaling Group
    name in the **Input parameters** section

    ![](media/ca613a3394ae9cadbc77e876007b8947.png)

8.  Click **Execute**

    Automation will run the document that remediates the missing AMI by creating
    the new AMI from running instance and updating the Auto Scaling Launch
    configuration. When the execution completes, you can see that there are 2
    running instances in the Auto Scaling group.

    ![](media/78fcbb8f77b1de190fb14c0d983da4aa.png)

    You can also see that CoudWatch alarm changes state to OK in a few minutes
